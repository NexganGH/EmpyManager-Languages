setup-no-perm-title: "Creating a Master Channel"
setup-no-perm-body: |
  Due to Discord's permissions, **Admin** permissions are required for the bot to create a category with correct permissions.
  
  However, you can follow the steps below if you want to avoid giving admin permissions:
  ```
  • Create a category
  • Add full permissions to the bot in the category
  • Use slash command: /setup-category <category>
  ```
setup-no-valid-category-error: Please choose a valid category. %channel% is not a category!
setup-no-perm-in-category: Make sure EmpyManager has full permissions inside the selected category!

setup-title: "✅ Master Channel Created"
setup-body: |
  ✅ I've created a **master channel** with id `%id%` for you!

  Your users can now join it to create their own temporary channels.
  
  Make sure to edit it as you like: you can change its name, permissions to join, user limit and bitrate. 
  
  **All temporary channels created from this master channel will inherit its user limit and bitrate.**
